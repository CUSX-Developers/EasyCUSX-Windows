# EasyCUSX
A Third-party PPPoE Client for CUSX school network

**EasyCUSX offical version now OFFLINE and won't support anymore**

# Introduction
### What is this
Just as the short description, this is a basically PPPoE client with some extra certificate auth protocol for my school network.

But it's easier to use, faster, and more good-looking than the school's client.

### Why is an Opensource Edition
I'm the only one to support the whole EasyCUSX series service(not only this PPPoE Client), as I can't afford the server and nobody interested in this project, I removed all online features(like Auto-update and EasyCloud Web service), rename and published this OpenSource edition. In EasyCUSX project, only this PPPoE Client will keep Developing and will stop someday.
