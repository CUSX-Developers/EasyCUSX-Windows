A Third-party PPPoE Client for CUSX school network

**EasyCUSX offical version is praparing for getting back to ONLINE**

# Introduction
### What is this
Just as the short description, this is a basically PPPoE client with some extra certificate auth protocol for my school network.

But it's easier to use, faster, and more good-looking than the school's client.

# Thanks
